"""The BBO does a great job of informing the public, but I feel something more should be done to really engage the community and make individuals feel comfortable to write in and even complain about attorneys that infringe on morality.I just had a case in my family wherein my ex-husband died, his sister had POA and """"reigned"""" above everything.  She hired an attorney, licensed in RI and MA.  My son never agreed to pay his fees at all, and even stated to him: """"Up to this moment, I am not responsible for your legal fees as my aunt hired you.""""  Would you believe this same lawyer had the nerve to have one of his assistants contact my son asking for a """"retainer""""?  Well, I instructed my son to write him a letter with the following statement:  """"My aunt hired you and I did not.  If you continue to insist on asking for fees and/or a retainer, I will be forced to report you to the RI Bar Association and the Massachusetts Board of Bar Overseers"""".  Since then, there has been no communication from that lawyer.And, ethnic communities are much more likely to suffer in silence, I know, because I was born in Portugal, raised in the US, and am familiar with the fear the Portuguese have of lawyers, the police and the Courts.

I had a hard time renewing online even though I thought I had linked to replace - when I thought I could complete the renewal I got an error in processing or something and told to try later. I had also mailed in an application but panicked because I thought I sent the wrong amount. That went to a PO box you provided. Later I re-wrote a bigger check and sent to 1000 washington st but check is too big and being returned. I still don't know if my first check was received at the PO box or if that was wrong too. I was writing out a lot of checks/bills at that point so can't remember who I sent it all to.

I believe she was concealing her actions. She demanded me to walk to the restroom. Threatened to evict from the shelter.  Knowing and seeing a wheelchair. I had permission as accomadation to sleep in an area to meet my needs. The supervisor on shift gave permission. Does the lower rank have authority over higher rank? Is in question. No apologies were made by the 2  female employees. I was even profiled by describing my color of skin/ethnicity was in doubt. Described """" white skinned"""".

"I am attempting to repair a shattered side window on my car.I have coverage for repair without a deductible. I do not want to use Safelight for repair and have been told I have the right by law to choose the repair shop of my choice. When I submitted the name of repair shop to whom I presumed was my Ins.co.I was told that shop was not licensed.I realized that my insurance co. refers policy holders to Safelight when you make 1st contact re.repair,without you realizing you are talking to Safelight not your Ins.co. Further, a subsidiary or connected company,Shop care(?) handles inquiries on licensing of repair shops.It would seem that in Ma. one firm with interests in the profitability of one repair shop, oversees the processing of claims,which would give them pricing information and thus an extreme competitive advantage over all other shops,as well as control which shops can do a covered repair through licensing role. This seems very wrong to me, am I missing something?",/locations/plymouth-aaa-limited-rmv-services,2018-06-08 00:00:00+00:00
