## Data Analysis

### Introduction

I decided to look into the question of whether health care expenditure has an affect on the rate of drug overdoses. Right now there are both esesential issues, with national debates over topics such as how health insturance should be administered and the best (and most cost effective) way to deal with the opiod crisis. These issues can also be highly localized to each state. 

### Gathering and Cleaning Data

Data was collected from the [Kaiser Foundation](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/health-spending-per-capita/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) and [Data.Gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/drug-poisoning-mortality-by-state-united-states).
